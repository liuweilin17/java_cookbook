In this article, we'll introduce the concepts of IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection)

Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. It's most often used in the context of object-oriented programming.

**If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.**

Dependency injection is a pattern through which to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is the setting of object's dependencies.
